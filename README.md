# ds-shellprogs

## There is a repository with many of dinoslavik's shell programs

## ðŸ›‘DISCLAIMERðŸ›‘ 
#### First of all, these programs and commands are created for the comfortable use of the operating system by their author (Dino Slavik), which means that these programs will be developed exclusively in the form in which the author needs them, no more, no less

### List of programs:
  * [ds-updatesys](https://github.com/DinoSlavik/ds-shellprogs/tree/main/ds-updatesys) - updates Debian-based distros
  * ds-progslist - list of all programs (parameter -i (--installed) makes it list with only installed programs)
